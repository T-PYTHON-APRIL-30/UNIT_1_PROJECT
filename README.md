## Project :  password generator with encryption :

#### Overview : this program will ask the user of the length of the password and their name and let them add a username then it will save the encrypted password in a file the user then will be able to use this program to decript the password this will insure that the passowrd that the user create are safe even if someone got the file with the encrypted passwords. 

#### As a user I should be able to do the following :
- create a username
- create a random password
- decrypt the password
- display the encrypted password
- display the key for the encrypted password
 

#### Usage :
 This is how to use my project: 
 - a menu will open up that has 4 options you can select the option by typing the numbers from 1 to 4 
 - if you select 1 you will have to type in a number more that 5 to generate a password
 - then type in your name
 - then type in a username
 - now the informations will be saved into 2 files one for the encypted password and the second for the generated key
 - if you type 3 on the menu you will get 3 new options if you type 1 the program will ask you to input your username to get your encrypted password and 2 will ask you the same but it will show you your key
 - if you type 3 on the submenu it will get you back to the main menu
 - typing 2 on the main menu will ask you to provide the encrypted password and the key to give you your password
 - finally type 4 on the main menu to exit
